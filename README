Heart-Domain-API

Welcome to my first CPAN contribution. A lot of the code in Heart::Domain::API still needs 
work, but it still works nonetheless.
It's an easy-to-use interface to Heart Internet's Domain Reseller XML API.
You won't need to bother with managing SSL sockets or parsing deep and complex XML structures.
Just worry about getting the domain functionality in your site with minimum hassle. This is 
exactly why I wrote Heart::Domain::API

INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

!! Don't forget to copy the Template directory to the path of your script.
!! Alternatively you can copy it anywhere and use Heart::Domain::API->{-path} to point
to its location.
    cp -r <path/to/perl/libs>/Heart/Template <path/of/script>/Template

That's it!

SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

Being my first release, and CPAN module, there isn't much documentation.
I've included some in the module itself, but I am working on some better support 
for this module. Please feel free to email brad@geeksware.net if you have any 
queries, bugs, or ideas to make this project better.
